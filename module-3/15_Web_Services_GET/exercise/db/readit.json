      "messageText": "Hi! Encapsulation and information hiding are crucial principles in object-oriented programming:\n\nEncapsulation:\n- Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) together as a single unit (class).\n- Hides internal implementation details, exposing only relevant interfaces to users.\n- Prevents direct access to object internals from outside the class.\n- Protects the integrity of data and ensures it's accessed and modified through controlled methods.\n\nBenefits:\n- Enhances code maintainability by isolating changes within the class.\n- Improves code robustness and security.\n\nThis promotes clean interfaces and improves collaboration in large codebases."
