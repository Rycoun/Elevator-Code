# Rental Shop

Design a rental shop that supports the following functions

1) Rents both Movies and Video Games.
2) Rentals have an unlimited period of days they can be rented for, but the number of days impacts the price.
3) Movies fall into categories of New Release, Classic, or Regular. The category also impacts the price. The category can change over time since a movie may go from new release to regular to classic.
4) The price of a game is $1 per day. The price of a movie is typically $1 per day. 
The price of a classic is $0.50 per day and a new release movie is $2 per day.
5) Customers can see their "statement" which is a receipt of all of their rentals and a summary of the total cost.
6) Customers also accrue "frequent renter points" for their rentals. They accrue 1 point for each dollar spent. Their total renter points should appear on their statement.
