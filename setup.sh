# This script assumes the student's repo has been cloned manually. The student
# should have logged onto https://git.techelevator.com/, found their repo, and cloned it.

# The script prompts the user for their name and email to configure their git settings.
# The script then continues with configuring their diff tool settings.

# INSTRUCTORS: set the `upstream_repo` variable with your instructor repo.
# The script uses this value to set it as an upstream for the student.
# The URL should look something like: "https://git.techelevator.com/campuses/nlr/jan-2022/java-green/instructor-code"
